Julia script to generate input file for the simulation code Superfish to calculate eigenmodes in elliptical cavities

Needs superfish installed into C:/LANL/
Geometry parameters are in cm.

"freq" Frequency in MHz that SuperFish uses to search for the eigenmode, shoudl be slightly lower than estimated frequency
"meshsize": size of triangle mesh
numberCells: number of elliptical cells, integer
freq_sim: Frequency (in MHz) for frequency scaling. First run use value entered in "freq", second run enter calculated frequency. This scales the cavity to the correct frequency

Geometry parameters for Center halfcells (multicell cavity), left end halfcell, right end halfcell, transition to left enlarged beampipe (if "enlargedBP_FPC = 1"), transition to right enlarged beampipe (if "enlargedBP_FPC = 1")
